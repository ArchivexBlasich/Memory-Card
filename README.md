# Memory Card Game

A simple React-based memory game where you click on cards without repeating the same player.  
Each unique click increases your score, while repeating ends the round.

## What I Learned
- Using React state to track score and best score.  
- Handling click events and updating UI dynamically.  
- Shuffling cards after each move.  

## How to Play
1. Click a card to score.  
2. Donâ€™t click the same card twice.  
3. Try to beat your best score!
